This project demonstrates a basic movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. It leverages collaborative filtering techniques to predict user ratings for movies based on the preferences of similar users.

## Features

- Collaborative filtering with k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
- Evaluation of the model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Basic user-item matrix creation from the MovieLens dataset

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies (install using `pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy`)
